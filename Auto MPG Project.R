#In this project I will investigate the impact of a number of automobile engine factors on the vehicleâ€™s mpg.

#Information regarding the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, and car name as well as mpg are contained in the file.

#scatter plot if horsepower affects mpg- miles per gallon seems to be clear negative linear correlation  with more horsepower lowering mpg number of cylinders also seems to be related but might be correlation not necessarily causation 
#average mpg is highest is most for 4 cylinder car becomes less for more cylinder but 3 cylinder might be specialty cars which also have more factors causing less mpg 
#scatter plot acceleration does not seem to be influencing mpg
#scatter plot weight seems to have negative linear correlation as well
#sheet 4 cars seem to be getting more efficient on average, the general upward trend of later cars going more miles per gallon.
#displacement negative linear relationship higher displacement less mpg
#displacement weight and horsepower seem to have similar curves, try to see why and maybe they are correlated. 
#The origin has an impact with cars produced in continent 3 have the highest mpg while in continent 1 the lowest.
